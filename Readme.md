# ðŸ¦€ Rust Learning Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of Rust projects!  
This repository is a curated set of small to medium-sized projects I built while learning Rust â€” covering everything from beginner syntax to advanced concepts like async, macros, and systems programming.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

Each folder in this repo is a standalone project focused on a specific concept or topic.  
Youâ€™ll find experiments, mini-apps, and some utilities built just for fun and learning.

<!--
### Project Examples
- `guessing_game/` â€“ The classic number guessing game (CLI)
- `http_server/` â€“ A simple single-threaded HTTP server from scratch
- `file_watcher/` â€“ Watches file changes using `notify`
- `async_chat/` â€“ A basic async TCP chat app using `tokio`
- `web_api_fastapi_clone/` â€“ A tiny web API using `axum` or `actix-web`
- `cli_tool/` â€“ A command-line utility with `clap`
